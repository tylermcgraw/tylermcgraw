## Hi there!

I'm Tyler. I am currently a student at Launch School. Here's a quick guide for browsing my repos. 

- All of the repos prefixed with JS or LS correspond to Launch School courses. [team2_request_bin](https://github.com/tylermcgraw/team2_request_bin) is my first team project - we are building a basket app for webhooks.
- I completed [CS50](https://github.com/me50/tylermcgraw/branches/yours
) in 2021 and used it in my high school computer science course in 2024.
- [Nand2Tetris](https://github.com/tylermcgraw/Nand2Tetris), as the name suggests, starts with a NAND gate and ends with a functioning Tetris game. In part 1 of the course we ended with building an assembler that translates assembly commands to machine language (using the Hack language).
- Odin Project repos include library, etch-a-sketch, and the one I enjoyed the most, [calculator](https://github.com/tylermcgraw/calculator).
